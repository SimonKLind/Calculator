# Calculator

This is a somewhat basic graphing calculator running purely in terminal.

It can evaluate expressions, with suppport for most common operations:
+, -, *, /, ^, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, ln, log, sqrt, rad, deg, abs.

It can store variables.

It can plot graphs from functions, several can be drawn at a time.

<name>=<expression> is the syntax for assigning variables, anything starting with y (e.g 'y1', 'y2'...) will be considered a function to plot

"plot <x-range> <y-range>" x-range and y-range will be absolute range of x and y axis, you can then zoom to adjust.
